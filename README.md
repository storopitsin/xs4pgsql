# xs4pqsql
Realization eXtensible Sheet tables (like Excel) for pgSQL (PostgreSQL)

This is a minimal implementation of some semblance of Excel sheets in PostgreSQL. It can be useful (and has been used) to build data marts to build reports in DevExpress (or similar reporting systems) if you need to replicate manually generated Excel reports using formulas. 

To install run xs_setup.bat or xs_setup.sh and follow instructions.
